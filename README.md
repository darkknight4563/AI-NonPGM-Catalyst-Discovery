# AI-NonPGM-Catalyst-Discovery
# AI-Driven Discovery of Non-PGM Catalysts for Automotive PEM Fuel Cells

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository hosts the data, scripts, notebooks, and results for our groundbreaking research applying artificial intelligence (AI) and computational chemistry techniques to discover platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Our goal is to accelerate the development of cost-effective, sustainable catalysts critical for the widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel cell technologies.

## 📌 Objectives
- Develop and validate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting catalyst performance.
- Identify novel, high-performance, and economically viable non-PGM catalysts.
- Reduce catalyst discovery timelines and costs significantly.
